def find_significant_kmers(data_pheno_path: str, classifier: str = "log", kmer_length: int = 13):
    '''
        Find kmers associated with the resistance phenotype in input genomed using phenotypeseeker.
        The kmer length is set to 13 by default. The classifier can be either "log" or "RF".
        The output file is filtered_kmers_and_coeffs.txt.
        The function returns 1 if the kmers were found, 0 if not.

        Also creates a ML model for predicting the phenotype in unseen genomes.

        Parameters:
            data_pheno_path: str - path to the data.pheno file
            classifier: str - classifier to use, either "log" or "RF"
            kmer_length: int - length of the kmers to find, default is 13
        Creates files:
